1. Remove the all migrations files within your project

Go through each of your projects apps migration folder and remove everything inside, except the __init__.py file.

2. Drop the current database, or delete the db.sqlite3 if it is your case.

3. Create the initial migrations and generate the database schema:

python manage.py makemigrations app_employees
python manage.py migrate app_employees zero
